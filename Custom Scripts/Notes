#B01 IFCONFIG vs IWCONFIG
	ifconfig: deals with all network adapters
	iwconfig: deals with only wireless network interfaces


#B02 CHANGE MAC ADDRESS
(1) [disable network adapter]
	>>ifconfig wlan0 down
(2) [new MAC address should start from 00:...]
	>> ifconfig hw ether <newMAC>
		[hw stands for hardware]
(3) [enable the wireless adapter]
	>>ifconfig wlan0 up


#WH01 ENABLE MONITOR MODE
(1) [disable network adapter before ebabling monitor mode] 
	>>ifconfig wlan0 down
(2) [kill all the ongoing network task - precautionary measure + better results]
	>>airmon-ng check kill
(3) [change to monitor mode from managed mode (default)]
	>>iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor
(4) [enable the wireless adapter]
	>>ifconfig wlan0 up
(4.1) [to cross check that monitor mode is enabled - check Mode=___]
	>>iwconfig

#WH02 PACKET SNIFFING [Tools- airodump-ng]
(0) Switch to monitor mode (say interface in monitor mode is named as wlan0)
(1) [to discover all wireless network in range]
	airodump-ng wlan0
		[to quit press Ctrl+C]
		
		[ BSSID--> MAC address of target, 
		  PWR--> signal strength, 
		  Beacons--> frames send by network to broadcast its existance,
			(all network devices even if hidden send these types of frames)
		  Data-->
		  #/s--> data packets collected in past 10s
		  CH--> Channel
		  MB--> max speed supported by network
		  AUTH--> security encryption use
		  ESSID--> name]


#WH03 WIFI BANDS SNIFFING [Tools- airodump-ng]
(0) default search for airudump-ng is only 2.4GHz.
(1) [To seaarch 5GHz]
	>> airodump-ng --band a wlan0

-->> airodump-ng --band <band/> wlan0
		<band/> = [ a--> 5GHz,
		  	 bg--> both use 2.4 GHz 
		  	 abg--> for both 2.4GHz & 5GHz at the same time
		  	 ac--> lower than 6GHz ]
	* do not specify band if u wanna search 2.4GHz band only


#WH04 TARGETED SNIFFING [Tools- airodump-ng, wireshark]
(1) [To search a specific target]
	>> airodump-ng --bssid 5C:F9:FD:62:FE:09 --channel 7 --write test wlan0

-->> airodump-ng --bssid <bssid/> --channel <ch/> --write <filename/> wlan0
	<bssid/> --> bssid of target
	<ch/> --> channel of target
	<filename/> --> name of file to write sniffed data of target
	* All these information is collected from the output of command "airodump-ng wlan0"

(2) The Output shows the number of devices connected to this network, and their MAC address under "STATION"
	Some devices that are trying to connect to this network will show under "PROBE"

(3) Now, when you quit using Ctrl+C, you can see the output data files (05 files - .cap, .csv, .netxml, .log.csv) with your name provided.

(4) In .csv file, it has everything that the connected devices do with internet, ie. passwords they entered, sites they visited, everyting they have done while you were sniffing.
	* ENCRYPTION: BUT, the data is encrypted using the Security Encryption (WPA2, WPA, WEP) Used by their Wifi Router.
	* OPEN NETWORK: If the network is open network then you can see every url visited, every password entered using 'Wireshark'.

	
#WH_A01 DEAUTHENTICATION ATTACK [Tools- aireplay-ng]
(0.1) Disconnect any client from any network
(0.2) Works on encrypted network (WEP, WPA & WPA2)
(0.3) No need to know the network key
(0.4) No need to connect to the network

-->> aireplay-ng --deauth [#DeauthPackets] -a [NetworkMAC] -c [TargetMac] [Interface]

	HOW IT WORKS:-
	Stakeholders involved: Hacker (us), Client (target), Access Point (Router)
	(0.5.1) First we pretent to be client who we want to disconnect by changing our MAC addresss to the MAC address of client, And tell the router that I want to disconnect from you.
		[pretent to be client by changing or MAC to client MAC, and send disconnect request]
	(0.5.2) Then, we pretent to be the router by changing our MAC to Router's MAC address and tell the client that you requested to be disconnected, so I am going to disconnect you.
		[pretent to be client by changing or MAC to client MAC, and tell you requested to be disconnected]
	(0.5.3) this allows us to disconnect/deauthenticate any client from any network.


(1) Gather bssid of target nwtwork using airodump-ng (#WH02)
(2) Gather MAC (station) of target by targeted sniffing using airodump-ng (#WH04)
(3) Make the airodump-ng running in the step-2, and open another terminal
(4) [send deauth requests using the following command]
	>>aireplay-ng --deauth 0 -a 5C:F9:FD:62:FE:09 -c B4:C4:FC:C8:6D:91 wlan0 

-->> aireplay-ng --deauth <number of packers/> -a <access point's MAC/> -c <client's MAC/> wlan0
	<number of packets/> = 0 (for infinite time attack)
	Alternate:
		--deauth: -0
